## Build process

The build process uses [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/).

1. Install the latest version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
2. Install Gulp globally `npm install gulp -g`
3. Install the dependancies locally `npm install`
4. To build:
  * To build once run `gulp`
  * To build and watch for changes run `gulp watch`
  * To clean the public directory run `gulp clean`
